"Linux users will likely have Python already installed, and packages "

"Next, you will be prompted for an API key. Keys are required to export "

" just press Enter."

"Finally, a prompt will ask you to enter a \"separator,\" a character "
"that's used to separate multiple pieces of data in a single CSV cell. "
"It's important that the chosen separator is a character that doesn't "
"appear in the actual data. The default choice is the \"pipe\" character "
"(`|`), which is usually a safe option. To use that default choice, just "
"press Enter, otherwise type the separator character you want to use "
"instead."

"The script will then run, and show output indicating its progress. The "
"exported results will be placed in files in the same folder as the "
"omeka-s-csv.py file: `items.csv`, `item_sets.csv`, and so on."
