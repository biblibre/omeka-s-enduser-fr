"Vocabularies are a collection of published RDF metadata Classes and "
"Properties for describing a Resource of a particular type. Linked open "
"vocabularies are created externally to Omeka, and, because they are "
"openly available, can be imported (with some limitations) into Omeka S "
"for use throughout the installation. If you have special and uncommon "
"item types or classes, you may wish to find and import a linked open "
"vocabulary to standardize the description of those particular items. "
