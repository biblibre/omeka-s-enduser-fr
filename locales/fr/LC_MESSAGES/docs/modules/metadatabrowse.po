"The Metadata Browse module makes it possible to browse all resources that"
" share a value for a particular metadata property."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/modules/metadatabrowse.md:5
msgid ""
"It does this by adding a link below selected properties that reads \"See "
"all items with this value\"; when clicked, the module returns the results"
" of that search (property value is equal to input). In function it is "
"similar to the Omeka Classic plugin [Search by Metadata](http://omeka.org"
"/add-ons/plugins/search-by-metadata/)."

msgid ""
"The \"Use global configuration on admin side\" checkbox determines how "
"the properties available for *admin side* metadata browsing (on items and"
" item sets views) are determined: by aggregating the properties selected "
"on all of the sites in the installation (unchecked) or limited to only "
"the properties."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/modules/metadatabrowse.md:19
msgid ""
"When the box is *unchecked*, metadata browse on the admin side (and only "
"the admin side) aggregates the metadata browse settings for all "
"individual sites and applies them to every item and item set in the "
"installation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/modules/metadatabrowse.md:21
msgid ""
"Leaving the box unchecked allows installation users to browse the "
"properties on the admin side which they have set as key on their sites. "
"For example, a site about various artists might have the Metadata Browse "
"enabled for 'Creator' (Dublin Core), while a site collecting conference "
"papers might enable Metadata Browse for 'presented at' (Bibliographic "
"Ontology); with the box unchecked, both 'Creator' and 'presented at' "
"would have Metadata Browse enabled on the admin views of all items and "
"item sets on the installation."
msgstr ""

"When the box is *checked*, individual site settings still apply on the "
"public views of those sites, but are not used on the admin side. Instead,"
" only those properties selected in the Metadata Browse module "
"configuration settings (the current page) are used on the admin side. So "
"if the global admin of the installation example above checked the Global "
"Configuration box and only enabled the properties 'Title' and 'Creator', "
"then the 'presented at' property would not include a \"See all items with"
" this value\" option on the admin side item browse."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/modules/metadatabrowse.md:25
msgid ""
"Checking the box can be used to limit the number of properties which have"
" Metadata Browse enabled on the admin side. If, for example, the site "
"about various artists mentioned above was using Metadata Browse on every "
"possible property, those Metadata Browse links would still be visible on "
"their site, but would not show up on the admin side. Instead, the Global "
"Administrator(s) could decided which properties to enable browsing on for"
" the admin side, thus reducing visual clutter."
