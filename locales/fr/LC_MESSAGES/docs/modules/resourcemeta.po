"The [Resource Meta module](https://omeka.org/s/modules/ResourceMeta/) "
"allows installation users to output resource metadata (items, item sets, "
"and media) as [`<meta>` elements in the "
"HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp) of their site pages. "
"Meta values are applied via [resource templates](../content/resource-"
"template.md): a metadata property in a template, such as "
"`dcterms:creator`, can be set to output as a meta tag, such as `<meta "
"name=\"dcterms.creator\" content=\"Shakespeare, William\">` inside the "
"`<head>` tag of the public page."
