"The [View Private Resources "
"module](https://omeka.org/s/modules/ViewPrivateResources) allows "
"installation administrators to change permissions for users at the Author"
" and Researcher level. Specifically it allows either, or both, of these "
"user levels to see view resources (items, media, and item sets) that are "
"set to private."

"[Logged-in users at any level](../admin/users.md#roles-and-permissions) "
"can always view resources that they own (that is, that they have created "
"or have had transferred to them), whether those resources are private or "
"public. By default, Authors and Researchers cannot see non-public "
"resources owned by others; all other user levels can see private "
"resources. Using this module can change these two settings so that "
"Authors and/or Researchers will have the ability to view (but not edit) "
"private resources owned by other users."
